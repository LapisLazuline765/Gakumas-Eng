*__In a classroom__*

__Ume:__ Hey, hey, China-chan.

__China:__ Hanami-san, what is it?

__Ume:__ The day after tomorrow is Valentine's Day, China-chan are you giving chocolate to someone?

__China:__ Ufufu, this year I am-<br />
__China:__ Going to give handmade chocolate to my grandfather.

__Ume:__ Eh, China-chan is making it?

__China:__ Last year the maids in the mansion helped me...<br />
__China:__ This year, I'm challenging it with my own power, I will surprise grandfather.

__Ume:__ Eh~, China-chan, that's great.

__China:__ Not that much~.

__China:__ Hanami-san, what will you be doing this year?

__Ume:__ Fufu, As for me...Onee-chan!

__China:__ Ufufu...just as I thought.

__Ume:__ Every year, Onee-chan and I make chocolates and exchange them!

__China:__ Oh, so that's how it is!

__China:__ [*doing an impression of Saki*] Ume, let's compete to see whose chocolate is more delicious!

__Ume:__ China-chan, that's not like her at all~.<br />
__Ume:__ We used to compete in the past, but it's not possible anymore.<br />
__Ume:__ My sister is teaching me now.

__Misuzu:__ ...fufu, what are both of you talking about?

__China:__ Hayate-san. Valentine's day is the day after tomorrow. We were discussing that.

__Misuzu:__ Valentine's, huh.

__Ume:__ Will Misuzu-chan give chocolates to anyone?

__Misuzu:__ When I was in middle school, the members of the unit I was in exchanged chocolate.<br />
__Misuzu:__ Mari-chan refused at first because she thought it would make her fat, but...<br />
__Misuzu:__ ...every year, she received it properly.<br />
__Misuzu:__ Mari-chan also secretly put chocolate in my shoe locker...fufu.

__Ume:__ Eh, why in the show locker!?

*__Outside of the classroom__*

__Hiro:__ [*listening in*] Valentine's...<br />
__Hiro:__ ...!

---

*__In the library__*

__Librarian:__ Yes, how can I help you? ...Eeeh!?

__Hiro:__ Books on how to make chocolate, I'll take all of them.<br />
__Hiro:__ "Western Confectionery Encyclopedia", "Professional Techniques"...

__Librarian:__ You will really take all of them? There are more than 30 books here.

__Hiro:__ I'm good at reading books.

__Librarian:__ No, that is not really the issue... Can you carry all of them?

__Hiro:__ ...fufu, leave it to me.<br />
__Hiro:__ [*struggling to lift the books*] ....nn....n...nnnnnn....!

__Librarian:__ Eh? W-wait, are you really okay!?

__Hiro:__ It was impossible.<br />
__Hiro:__ I'll just read it here after all.

*__Time passes in the library__*

__Hiro:__ ...Whew. I almost got it. All that's left to do is make it according to theory.

*__In the communal kitchen__*

__Hiro:__ ...-<br />
__Hiro:__ ...why did this happen?<br />
__Hiro:__ ...fufu, I can't help it.

__Rinami:__ [*walks in the lunchroom*] Hmm? What is that scorching smell...?<br />
__Rinami:__ [*walks towards the communal kitchen*] Is anyone there?

__Hiro:__ ...-

__Rinami:__ Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

#### Valentine Concerto Part 2

*__In the communal kitchen__*

__Rinami:__ ...there, I got all the chocolate. Even so, I was surprised.

__Hiro:__ I was surprised too. Fufu.

__Rinami:__ ...anyway, Hiro-chan, what were you making?

__Hiro:__ ...Chocolate. For Valentine's.

__Rinami:__ Eh!? Hiro-chan, Valentine's?
__Rinami:__ Who will you be giving it to?

__Hiro:__ ...it's a secret.

__Rinami:__ ...is that so. Fufu.

__Hiro:__ Rinami. I have a request.

__Rinami:__ Hmm, what is is?

__Hiro:__ I want you to sample the chocolate I made.<br />
__Hiro:__ I want an objective evaluation.

__Rinami:__ A small request! ...So, is this it?

__Hiro:__ It's not solidified yet. Scoop it up with a spoon.

__Rinami:__ Then, hmm...?<br />
__Rinami:__ [*tries chocolate*]...nn...u...n?

__Hiro:__ So?

__Rinami:__ ...Hiro-chan, this...<br />
__Rinami:__ I don't taste it!?<br />
__Rinami:__ Eh, w-why? How did you make it!?

__Hiro:__ I read a book about making specialized chocolate making-

__Rinami:__ [*nods*] Hmm.

__Hiro:__ I thought it wouldn't be interesting making it normally.

__Rinami:__ ...hmm?

__Hiro:__ Fufu, to make the ultimate chocolate...<br />
__Hiro:__ I tried to adopt all the theories of making delicious chocolate.

__Rinami:__ ...A-and then?

__Hiro:__ Probably, the theories caused interference with each other -<br />
__Hiro:__ And made the taste disappear.

__Rinami:__ I see. Like the three primary colors of light... Wait, is there such a thing!?

__Hiro:__ In the world of learning, mysterious phenomenons can occur.

__Rinami:__ You are making chocolate, right?

__Hiro:__ ...This is a failed work. Onto my next challenge.

__Rinami:__ Um, Hiro-chan.

__Hiro:__ ...?

__Rinami:__ If you would like, we can make chocolate together?

__Rinami:__ The day after tomorrow the student council will be sponsoring a Valentine's Day festival.<br />
__Rinami:__ I was planning to make a lot of chocolate.

__Hiro:__ ...thank you, but...<br />
__Hiro:__ I want to make the chocolate by myself.<br />
__Hiro:__ Otherwise it doesn't make sense...to have... [*passes out*]

__Rinami:__ Eh? Hiro-chan!?

*__Time passes in the lunchroom__*

__Rinami:__ There you go. I was surprised because you suddenly collapsed.

__Hiro:__ [*laying down on a couch*] ...Anemia. I was standing all that time.

__Rinami:__ Are you okay? Do you want to eat the chocolate? It's effective to help anemia.

__Hiro:__ ...I'm fine.

__Rinami:__ Oh, it's better not to stand just yet. Lie down a bit longer.

__Hiro:__ ...-

__Rinami:__ Hey, Hiro-chan- what kind of chocolate do you want to make?

__Hiro:__ ...what kind?<br />
__Hiro:__ ...I didn't really think about it.

__Rinami:__ Is that so. Well, it might be better to think about it first.<br />
__Rinami:__ Imagine someone you care about and want to give chocolate to.<br />
__Rinami:__ What kind of chocolate would they be happy with?<br />
__Rinami:__ Taste, shape, size, color, wrapping, ribbon decoration...<br />
__Rinami:__ Thinking about all these things is the most fun.

__Hiro:__ ...an important person. That's difficult...

__Rinami:__ It's also a good idea to ask yourself what kid of chocolate you would be happy with.

__Hiro:__ ...I would want it to be a surprise.

__Rinami:__ Is that right?

__Hiro:__ For reference, what kind of chocolate would Rinami like?

__Rinami:__ Me? Hmm, well...<br />
__Rinami:__ I would be happy with any chocolate if it was chosen with me in mind.

__Hiro:__ ...-

__Rinami:__ ...Oh, sorry. That's not very helpful.<br />
__Rinami:__ Um...how about asking other people's opinions?

__Hiro:__ ...yes, I want to gain a wide variety of answers.

__Rinami:__ That's right...who would be good to ask?
__Rinami:__ Mao, lots of juniors, ah, that's right...<br />
__Rinami:__ At this time, maybe there is-<br />

__Hiro:__ Who?

__Rinami:__ The person at Hatsuboshi Gakuen who gets the most chocolate.
