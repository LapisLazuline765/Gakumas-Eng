*__In the producing room__*

__Hiro:__ Producer, producer.
__Hiro:__ I want you to teach me how to cook.

__Producer:__ What kind of food do you want to make?

__Hiro:__ Today's Producer is buying into it too fast. Normally you are like ...
__Hiro:__ [*doing an impression of Producer*] "-That's sudden. What are you planning on doing today?"
__Hiro:__ That's what it's usually like. While giving me a look.

__Producer:__ Every time... in the end I end up doing your requests, so I'm cutting out an unnecessary conversation.

__Hiro:__ ...that's not good.
__Hiro:__ I think you should enjoy conversations with the idol you've been working with.

__Producer:__ Fu- that's blunt. So, what are you planning on doing today?

__Hiro:__ ...fufu. I can't say yet. I would like you to teach me how to cook.

__Producer:__ ...

__Hiro:__ Producer has...lovely wrinkles between his eyebrows.

__Producer:__ So...what kind of food do you want to make?

__Hiro:__ Hm-...umm...huh.
__Hiro:__ "What I really want to make" cannot be taught.
__Hiro:__ But I want to improve my poor cooking. Something easy and quick.
__Hiro:__ I hope I can do something about my skills.

__Producer:__ I understand now. Let's try making a lot of things.

__Hiro:__ If you make a lot of various things...even if you don't know "what I really want to make".
__Hiro:__ I might be able to get learn it? Maybe I can learn a similar cooking method to what I need?

__Producer:__ There is also that... Overall...
__Producer:__ I want you to improve your cooking skills.

__Hiro:__ Is it because...you want to eat my homemade cooking?

__Producer:__ Because cooking training is difficult.

__Hiro:__ ...you found out.

__Producer:__ Of course, I knew it.
__Producer:__ It remind me of the first time I heard "supplementary lessons".

__Hiro:__ That is...a good memory. It was fun, wasn't it?

__Producer:__ I almost had to put restrictions on my idol's activities.

__Hiro:__ Fufu, it was very close. This is how I like to live though, right?

__Producer:__ I don't like to hear things like that.
__Producer:__ Not being able to finish your classes in not a hobby.

__Hiro:__ That's right. It's just as you said.
__Hiro:__ Producer, I...I'll seriously learn how to cook.
__Hiro:__ I'm in your care.
